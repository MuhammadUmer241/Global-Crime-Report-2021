This repository showcases an in-depth analysis of global crime trends using Power BI. The project leverages a dataset sourced from Kaggle and meticulously cleaned for optimal visualization. The data is organized into three key tables:

GDP_PER_Capita: Houses data on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for various countries.
Country_Code: Provides unique country codes for identification and data manipulation.
Orgranized_Crimes: Contains detailed information on organized crime activity, including criminality ratios, mafia group ratios, resilience scores, and specific crime types (e.g., drugs, fauna and flora crimes).
